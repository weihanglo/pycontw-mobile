		"abstract": "AI is all about training machine to make intelligent decisions automatically—or we may at least dream about that. However, before building a successful AI system, we need to make human choices when developing strategies and setting directions for training machines. For AI system developers, making the right choices is critical to training AI systems into where they are wanted to be, just like a baseball coach who develops strategies and gives instructions to train a winning team. Hsuan-Tien is sharing his thoughts in this keynote on how developers can make good choices for AI before AI can make smarter decisions for you.",
